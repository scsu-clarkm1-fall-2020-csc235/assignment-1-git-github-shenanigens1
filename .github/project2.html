    <h2>Mode of Attack</h2>
    <p1>There are a variety of ways that attacks as such can occur. One way is to create a fake network that allows the deviant to view all information going through your computer,
         or in other cases ask the user to enter standard information like sign in and password. Other ways that this happens is creating a fake update that leaves a trace for the deviant to come back and 
        look at information remotelty from a computer. This does not take a lot of time, which is why it is warned to not access public wifi as it is dangerous what HAckers can get out of it.</p1>
